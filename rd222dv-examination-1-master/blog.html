            <h2>Why is it important to seperate the layout and design (css) from content (html)?</h2>
            <p>
                It is important to separate the layout and design (css) from content (html), because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> To avoid code duplication. One would notice this mainly, when changing the color of a commonly
                    used
                    element. If layout and design wouldn’t be separated from content, and it would be needed to change
                    the
                    design of the site, it could lead to making hundreds of changes instead of only one.</li>
                <li> To be able to change the layout and design without even touching the content.</li>
                <li>It is not only beneficial from the designs site, but the separation of content makes adding or
                    updating things easy while maintaining presentational consistency throughout the site.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is Open Graph</h2>
            <p>
                The Open Graph protocol turns any web page into a rich object on social media websites, such as
                Facebook or Twitter. It is necessary to add basic metadata to the page, so that this page can be turned
                into graph objects. There are four required properties for every page: title, type, image and url. When
                sharing your website on social media websites, these tags convert your website link into a rich object
                with a title, type and image that represents the site.
                <br>
                For my blog page, I am linking this page and I set the title to “Hodor – Blog” and the representing
                image is Hodor’s head from the index page.

                Another text file is the humans.txt. This file contains information about people who developed that
                website, their contact and names, and often which standards and components and more info about what
                they used for building the site. The humans.txt file for this site contains the Project details such as
                the project name, the url and date when it was created, which standards and software was used and also

            <h2>What is robots.txt</h2>
            <p>
                The text file robots.txt is used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and can be found in a
                website’s root folder. In this file it is specified with a “Disallow”, which areas of the website
                should not be scanned. For this site, the contact.html page is configured as disallowed to be read.

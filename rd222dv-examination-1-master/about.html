                <p>Hodor is overjoyed by basic things like presenting Bran with a new saddle or hearing the echo of his
                    own
                    voice. Despite his large size and strength, Hodor is a gentle soul who is terrified by
                    violence - even violence doneby himself, as he often cowers in fear instead of fighting back
                    against
                    foes who are actually smaller than he is .
